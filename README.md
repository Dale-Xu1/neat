# NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies)

## Overview

This implementation is based on this paper by the University of Texas at Austin: https://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf

NEAT is a neuroevolution algorithm that evolves the topologies of the networks along with their weights. This project contains an example training a model to solve XOR.
